            <h1>NBA</h1>
            <p>With the NBA Draft in his sights, star Canadian basketball prospect Bennedict Mathurin is ready to make his dreams come true.
            The 19-year-old Montreal native has had a plan to play in the NBA since he was in high school, dismissing any idea that he would be anything other than a player in the world’s greatest basketball league.
            “Not a lot of people believed in me,” Mathurin said in a video conference Tuesday. “I remember me telling my teachers in high school that I wanted to be an NBA player and then they all asked me (what) my plan B and C and D (were).”
             The teachers’ questions were likely coming from a good place. Bennedict was considered just a four-star college recruit when he began high school — as opposed to a can’t-miss five-star prospect — and wasn’t receiving the kind of offers you’d expect from a future NBA player. </p>
